Rascal, n: Synonym for rogue.

Rascal is a very simple roguelike game. I like to re-implement it in
different languages, as an exercise in learning a new language more
deeply.

This is the Python 3 version.

To play:
 - get the source checkout
 - execute "bin/rascal". It's a bash script that should be 
   able to find and load the correct libraries

COMMANDS

 * h - move left
 * j - move down
 * k - move up
 * l - move right
 * q - quit

Move into a monster to attack it.
