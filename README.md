Rascal, n: Synonym for rogue.

Rascal is a very simple roguelike game. I like to re-implement it in
different languages, as an exercise in learning a new language more
deeply.

This is the Python 3 version.

To play:
 - be using a modern Unix-like system (Linux, OSX, *BSD, etc.) *
 - get the source checkout
 - execute "bin/rascal"

COMMANDS

 * h - move left
 * j - move down
 * k - move up
 * l - move right
 * q - quit

Move into a monster to attack it.

* It's not strictly necessary to have a unix-like system to run
this. You can run it on Windows, but must have an equivalent of the
curses library installed, and set up the PYTHONPATH manually. Read the
source of bin/rascal for clues.
