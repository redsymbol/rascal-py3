Rascal, n: Synonym for rogue.

Rascal is a very simple roguelike game. I like to re-implement it in
different languages, as an exercise in learning a new language more
deeply.

This is the Python 3 version.

COMMANDS

h - move left
j - move down
k - move up
l - move right
q - quit

Move into a monster to attack it.
